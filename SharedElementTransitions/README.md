# Shared Element Transitions
This repo contains working code for implementing Activity to Activity and Fragment to Fragment(soon) shared element transitions. 

## Bonus
This repo also contains code to listen for events like whether “*Enter Animation*” has completed or not and them do something on completion and whether “*Exit Animation*” is about to start or not and then execute code before it's starting.
